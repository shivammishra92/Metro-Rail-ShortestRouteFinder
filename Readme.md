<h2>A brief about the project is here:</h2>

This is a simple C++ program that will take information (name) of the source station and the destination station, of Kanpur Metro, from the user and display the shortest metro route to reach the destination. It will also be having a metro map for commuterâ€™s better navigation.

The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap/Set data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. Nodes represent a metro station that will be containing certain information regarding that station like its name, its metro corridor, and the lines which it connects. Edges (the connection between two nodes) represent the distance between the two stations and the cost of each edge will be equal to the distance between the two of its connecting stations(nodes).

By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search etc, the shortest path between the source station and the destination station is determined. Finally, the metro route between the two stations is displayed.

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The project can run on any Online or Offline Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, GDB.com, codeblocks etc. You should have at least elementary knowledge of C++ Programming language to work on this project. Knowledge of data structures like Graph and Heap/Set and Algorithms like Dijkstra, BFS, DFS ... etc is appreciated.
